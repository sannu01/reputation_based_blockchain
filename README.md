# reputation_based_blockchain Simulation

A reputation-based mechanism that allows each node to compute a
 reputation value for each of its neighbors. Intuitively, a node
 forwarding more valid and fewer spam transactions would have a
 higher reputation.

<pre>
 Motivation
 • To increase the throughput of non-spam transactions.
 • To avoid the increase of transaction fees of non-spam transactions.
 • To reduce the uses of computational resources for verifying spam 
transactions

Simulation Result

<pre>As the number of Malicious node increases in the network the number of invalid transaction 
 spread decreases compared to when Malicious Nodes were lessbecause the proportion of valid 
 transation decreases and the reputation valus of node does not increases to let them attack the network.</pre>
